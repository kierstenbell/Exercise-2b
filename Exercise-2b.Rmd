## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R Markdown can function like Latex and use equations
-  $\alpha >\beta$ 

There's actually a nifty Latex code generating website [Latex Code Logs](https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php)

## Fun Addition 
```{r numbers}
x <- 5
y <- 6
(z <- x+y)
```
## Highlighting Module 7 + 8 

Module 7: matrices, lists, and data frames 
Matrices are two dimensional data structures 
```{r matrices}
(m <- matrix(1:30, nrow=5, ncol=7))
(n <-(matrix(1:100, nrow=5, ncol=6, byrow = TRUE)))
```
Notice that R recycles the numbers 

Arrays are n-dimensional data structures 
```{r}
a <- array(dim=c(5, 6, 3), data=1:90)
dim(a)
class(a)
attributes(a)
str(a)
```
You can reference or extract select elements from vectors, matrices, and arrays by subsetting them using their index positions in what is known as brack notation *[]*

## Pulling out items within the matrices based on index position

```{r}
v <- 1:100
v[33:35]
v[(c(1, 4, 50))]
cheers <- c("c","h","e","e","r","s")
cheers[c(2,5)]
```

## Lists and dataframes
```{r}
s <- c("this", "is", "a", "vectors", "of", "strings")
m <- matrix(data=1:40, nrow=5, ncol=8)
b <- FALSE
l <- list(s, m, b)
l <-list(string = s, matrix = m, bool = b)
attributes(l)
length(l)
```

## Subsetting Lists
Now we are using double brackets! 
You can reference or extract elements from a list similarly to how you would from other data strucutre, except that you would use double brackets[[]] to reference a single element in the list
```{r}
l[[2]]
l[[2]][2,6]
```
Note the difference between l[] and l[[]]
```{r}
l[2]
l[[2]]
```
Single brackets will have $matrix. So if you are wanting to actually interact with the data within the matrix, you will have to use [[]]

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  firstName = c("Rick", "Negan", "Dwight", "Maggie", "Michonne"), 
  community = c("Aleandria", "Saviors", "Saviors", "Hilltop","Saviors"),
  sex = c("M", "M", "M", "F", "F"),
  age = c(27, 28, 40, 23, 21)
)
```

Data from Excel
```{r}
## Not really sure what happened here in class. Whoops. Go back and rewatch video. 
# library(readxl)
# f <- file.choose()
# df <- read_excel(
#  path = f, sheet = 1, 
#  col_names = TRUE
# )
# head(df)
# class(df)
# str(df)
```

## Getting Started with Module 8
```{r}
f <- "/Users/Kiersten/Downloads/CPDS-1960-2014-reduced.csv"
d <- read.table(f, header= TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)

## if running later on, these will be helpful: tidyverse, data.table
# work through module 7 + 8
```
